# elevate

Multipurpose Discord bot with entertainment and utility features.

Elevate serves no real practical use, it's just a bot with some fun commands in my friend group servers.

## Installation

You're going to need any version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) higher than 16.9.1, along with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) (which should come with node anyway.)

If you have [git](https://git-scm.com) already, you can run `git clone https://github.com/infinixius/elevate` to get a local copy of the code. If you don't, you can use the "Download Code" button.

Finally, run `npm install` where the repository is to install all the NPM modules needed.

## Setup

Once you have Elevate installed, rename both `config.template.json` to `config.json`.

config.json should be updated to configure the bot properly.

An explanation of config.json can be found in `/docs/Config.md` or [here](https://infinixius.github.io/elevate/Config.md).

Once configured, you can now run `node index` for the bot to start. A list of commands can be found by running `cmds`.
